To determine the positioning accuracy by training the data using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

A smartphone and BLE beacons are being used to collect co-ordinates and RSSI values for a dataset. In
addition, the accuracy of positioning is determined by using Neural Network algorithms to train the dataset. Using performance metrics such as Euclidean distance, MAE and RMSE to compare results and select the best model.
